## Why I made my project
1. It was renran's idea lol ur so cool renran
2. I wanted to make a document because sometimes people (I am people) prefer reading docs to slideshows or Youtube videos!! Also people with potato quality laptops (I am people) whos laptops sometimes crash when opening content-heavy slides ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

## How I made my project
I used Astro & VSCode! I first wrote a .md with the main contents of the document and then installed TailwindCSS on Astro to style my .md file! Then I made another .md for the license page & styled it with TailwindCSS as well :)

## Struggles + things I learned
Deploying with Astro was one of (if not the hardest) part of this project... I made like four typos and they cost me four hours... (here's the complete timeline of the Astro struggle)

It honestly shouldn't have been as hard as it was (thanks for phthallo for giving me advice btw I messed up a bunch of commits and I think accidentally merged something) but... it was really hard... this repo is called storyboard2 because I messed up too many commits and gave up on the original repo [link here if you want to judge... idk what i was doing](https://github.com/ikealoverkat/Storyboard-Renpy-Guide-Doc)

Anyways, I learned how to deploy using Github Actions so yay ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

Have fun reading the docs! If you're actually reading this as a Storyboard participant & not an Athena person, good luck!!!!! If you're reading this as an Athena person... do Storyboard...
